    "Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) work by moving small filters across an input image. One filter can be regarded as a reception. It acts like a sight neure which 'sees' one part of input image one time, and can get activated accordingly. This makes Convolutional Netwroks very powerful on capturing patterns, and thus can keep more complex information than simple multilayer perceptrons(MLP). The differenc between CNN and MLP is that CNN has convolution layers. Besides, MLP has the layers same with the CNN's rest layers (we call them fully connected layers, or FC layers in terms of CNN).
